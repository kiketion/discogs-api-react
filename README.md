# Discogs API React

This is a single page application, developed using React and Discogs API.

Includes a search box that allows the user to search for specific terms (e.g., searching for “Daft Punk” should return releases relating to Daft Punk).

A history of all searches of the user. (If you search for Linking Park and then you search for Nirvana the user see both Linking Park and Nirvana in the history) the history is persistent, if the user refreshes the page the history should be there.

Deployed in Vercel. You can try it here! https://discogs-api-react.vercel.app/
